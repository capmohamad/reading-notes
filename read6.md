background-color
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.

You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names (covered on the next page).

If you do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent.

By default, most browser windows have a white background, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background is white you can use the background-color property on the body element.



CSS colors
There are many methodes to add color in CSS:

Name — > color:black;
RGB — > color: rgb (red value, Green value, Blue value); note that rgb has values from 0 - 255, and you can Alfa to it; which is opacity.
hexadicimal — > # 00 00 00
hsl — > color:hsl(hue value, saturation value, lightness value); hue: is the degree of color on wheel from 0 - 360 Saturation: shade of grey from 0% - 100% lightness: from 0% - 100% ( also note that you can add Alfa to hsl too, alfa value = 0.0 - 1.0)
