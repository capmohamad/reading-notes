What the deffirence between HTML & Javascript

Both JavaScript and HTML are high-level programming languages used in conjunction with each other to create web pages. HTML, short for Hypertext Markup Language, is a standard computer language used to tag text files in order to achieve color, font, graphic, and hyperlink effects on web pages.

While HTML is used to create the basic structure of web pages, JavaScript is like an advanced iteration of the HTML used to make web pages more dynamic and interactive. JavaScript is definitely one of the most versatile scripting languages used to add dynamic content to websites by manipulating the content of the pages.

HTML simply is a set of codes inserted in a file to display on a web page, meaning it decides how a webpage should look, whereas JavaScript is a more advanced language used to make a website look good in a dynamic fashion. Let’s take a look at the two in detail.

 

 What do we mean when we thinks about HTML !!


HTML is an acronym which stands for Hypertext Markup Language. From the name, it may sound a bit scary but it’s a basic markup language used to create web pages and web applications from plain simple text.

In simple terms, if you want to build a web page or web application, you have to start with HTML. It’s the stepping stone to web development and the journey to learning code begins with HTML.

The World Wide Web is a collection of millions of documents that are connected together by hyperlinks. Even a web page is just a hypertext document.

HTML simply adds some meaning to the text using a set of instructions that better describe how the text should be laid out. In simple terms, it’s a basic language used to format plain text to make them stand out and give them a proper structure.

And What is JavaScript mean !!


JavaScript is a high-level scripting language introduced by Netscape to be run on the client-side of the web browser. It’s more of a technology that makes a website more interactive by manipulating the content of the website.

It’s a multi-paradigm programming language based on the concept of object-oriented programming and is used to create interactive effects within web browser without even interacting with the server side of the browser.

It’s often confused with Java, thanks to its name but it has no association with the Java language. While both are derived from the C language and even share some syntax, they are totally based on different programming paradigms.

Unlike HTML, it’s only used in the front-end to create dynamic web pages, which include programs that can interact with the user to create dynamic pages. It simply enhances HTML pages to make web pages interactive and dynamic.


Loops 

A for loop is similar to a while loop, but streamlines the source code. The for loop statement defines the start and end point as well as the increment for each iteration. Below is the same loop above defined as a while loop.
