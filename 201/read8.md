Key Concepts in
Positioning El ements
Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use
borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

Normal flow:

Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one.
Even if you specify the width
of the boxes and there is space
for two elements to sit side-byside,
they will not appear next
to each other. This is the default
behavior (unless you tell the
browser to do something else).
Relative Positioning:

This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed. This
does not affect the position of
surrounding elements; they stay
in the position they would be in
in normal flow.
Ab solute positioning :


This positions the element
in relation to its containing
element. It is taken out of
normal flow, meaning that it
does not affect the position
of any surrounding elements
(as they simply ignore the
space it would have taken up).
Absolutely positioned elements
move as users scroll up and
down the page.

Creating Multi-Column  Layouts with Floats
width
This sets the width of the
columns.
float
This positions the columns next
to each other.
margin
This creates a gap between the
columns.
A two-column layout like the one
shown on this page would need
two <div> elements, one for the
main content of the page and
one for the sidebar.
Inside each of the <div>
elements there can be headings,
paragraphs, images, and even
other <div> elements.
 
 So fore summry
 - <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
