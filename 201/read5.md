HTML (img)

Definition and Usage. The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image. The <img> tag has two required attributes: src - Specifies the path to the image.

Color 

So colors outside the sRGB gamut can be specified in Cascading Style Sheets by making one or more of the red, green and blue components negative or greater than 100%, so the color space is theoretically an unbounded extrapolation of sRGB similar to scRGB. Specifying a non-sRGB color this way requires the RGB() function call. It is impossible with the hexadecimal syntax (and thus impossible in legacy HTML documents that do not use CSS).

Text

 It's HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page  also provide semantic information  where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation
● Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs
● Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on
