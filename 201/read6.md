Functions

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements),
All so A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, 
but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious 
relationship between the input and the output

Every function in JavaScript is an instance of the Function constructor:

// x, y is the argument. 'return x + y' is the function body, which is the last in the argument list.
var add = new Function('x', 'y', 'return x + y');
add(1, 2); // => 3


The Document Object Model (DOM)

A programming interface for HTML and XML documents,
 It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure,
 style, and content. ... The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page,
 which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript and know as
a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically
 access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.

What is the HTML DOM?
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

The HTML elements as objects
The properties of all HTML elements
The methods to access all HTML elements
The events for all HTML elements
In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
