HTML Comments


Comments are a crucial part of well-written code. They can document the function of different elements of a site, which can be invaluable as you are learning code and may be prone to forgetting what different parts of your file are for. They also can be used to temporarily eliminate portions of your code that are not working correctly, which may be helpful as you troubleshoot problems. Finally, in advanced coding, comments are used to communicate with other web technologies - you may not need to know this now, but if you find comments that look a lot like computer code elsewhere on the Web, it may prove useful. Keep in mind however, that comments are delivered with the functioning code, so they are available to any curious user who looks at the source code for a website.

So, how can a thoughtful learning professional address ? 

 the varied needs of adult and child learners and incorporate both teacher-centered and student-centered practices? The following list provides a few suggestions:

Regardless of the audience’s demographics and background, frame learning in the context in which participants will apply it; make it real.
Provide the WFIM (what’s in it for me) for participants to increase receptivity and cultivate a desire to learn.
Increase engagement by soliciting stories and examples from participants, adults and children alike, which also reinforces the relevance of learning.
Provide options, particularly around application activities, e.g. “Choose from one of the following scenarios”, “Make a final presentation on a topic about which you might speak in real life”, etc.
Use simulations, case studies, labs, on the job training practices, etc. to mimic expectations about what the learners must physically do either on the job, or when they get into “the real world”.
Leverage natural curiosity and drive by building engaging experiences that grab the participants’ attention and prompt them to want to know more.


Pair prog pair program

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
